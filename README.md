# SQLProjects

## About these projects

During my 2023 university break I decided to delve further into SQL, which we covered briefly in the Master's. I scored well on the assignment, but I definitely needed more exposure and practice. I have been through Maven Analytics (https://mavenanalytics.io/) Basic SQL course (and may post my work here for my own review) and am currently toward the end of the Advanced SQL course. I then plan to take another course that will cover CTEs, and then post my own projects. The scripts I post here are from the course exercises, either working through the solution given but also many cases where I have a different solution that I implemented to get the same results.

In the advanced series, I've been practising sub queries and temporary tables quite a lot, but what's good about this course is the way the questions force you to think like an analyst. For example, when your manager sends you a request for data to be pulled in a certain way, whilst you understand the various joins, case statements and how to do sub-queries and temp tables, you have to think about aggregation first, so that you can pull in data at each step in a way that is easy to aggregate at the end. This for me took the most time to master as it requires a very planned approach, and I think th course does an excellent job at providing ample practice for that. 

I'm taking my time working through these exercises, and will post the rest of the course scripts once I've finished the remainder (one section) of the course. Going through it whilst posting will be useful for my own revision, and it will be good to see if the problems I found challenging are now easier considering I'm towards the end of the course.
